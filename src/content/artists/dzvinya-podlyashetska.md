Dzvinya Podlyashetska born in Lviv, UA is a painter of naive grotesque and ironic utopia who explores the unity of humans with nature, the paradoxes of society, and the psychological and spiritual depths of the individual through a colorful, expressive, and seemingly intuitive visual language. Her big scale canvases and paper works depict a world where animals and humans coexist under the same universal laws, where every character embodies an unspoken emotion or memory. Irony and social critique allows her to question the absurdity of human habits, power, ecology, consumption, and alienation. At the same time, she strives for the viewer to feel warmth, naive joy, and a peculiar harmony, even in the most grotesque images. Her art is a dialogue between dreams and reality, between sincerity and sarcasm, between who we are and who we could be.
