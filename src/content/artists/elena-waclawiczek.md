Elena Waclawiczek, born in 1986, is a transdisciplinary performance artist. She studied at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and the Aalto University of Art and Design in Helsinki. She currently lives in Vienna and Paris. Her work is characterized by a subtle, playful, yet radical approach to the human body, exploring both its material and immaterial dimensions. Improvisation and collective composition are central as both a method and subject of her artistic research. She is the founder of the association „LiSi*A - Liberating Structures for Improvised Art" (since 2021) and was connected to the EU project and network „SHAREImpro" (2020 - 2022). Since 2022 she is part of the Center for Arts and Culture Semmelweisklinik. In this context, she collaborates with artists from various disciplines across Europe and worldwide. Her work has been showcased in galleries, cultural centers, theaters, festivals, and exhibitions across cities including Vienna, Paris, Prague, Venice, Sarajevo, Ljubljana, Lisbon, Helsinki and Johannesburg, among others.
