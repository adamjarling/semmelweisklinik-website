Nathalie has a weird brain fascinated with patterns, connections, fibres and doodles. Weaving memories, found objects and words into a new shape, she slowly creates a language for what she has to say. The daughter of a French artist and American programmer draws on her medical/science background as much as on her tactile curiosity to explore the world and find similarites in odd places.
