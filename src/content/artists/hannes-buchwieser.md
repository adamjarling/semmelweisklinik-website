Hannes Buchwieser (*1986, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany) is a Vienna-based video artist and experimental musician whose work explores the relationship between individuals, modern societal structures, and technology. His practice spans video art, interactive installations, experimental music, and long-term collaborations at the Ars Electronica Center in Linz. With a background in Time-Based and Interactive Media Art from the University of Art Linz, he works across disciplines to challenge perceptions and foster dialogue between art, technology, and society.

Since 2022, Buchwieser has focused on merging microscopy and media art in his ongoing art-and-science project, developed within the BioLab at Ars Electronica. His work includes programming, Deep Space dance performances, video art, and interactive installations.

His projects have been exhibited internationally, including at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich (2022), Ars Electronica Festival (2023, 2024), Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (2024), Bauhaus-University Weimar (2024), and through collaborations with the Institute of Dance Arts (Anton Bruckner University) and the University of Art Linz (2022-2025).

His short film Who Owns The Truth, created at the Ars Electronica BioLab, won 1st Prize at Conservatorio Das Artes Madeira, Portugal (2024), and was screened internationally at the Ecoperformance Film Festival (2024) in Sao Paulo, Rhode Island, Bucharest, Pinamar, and Cordoba. It was also broadcast on Upper Austrian station DorfTV and shown at the Ars Electronica Festival (2023), Kunstverein Rosenheim (2023), Althangrund Vienna (2023), and as a special feature during Open Studios 7 at the Semmelweisklinik (2024).
