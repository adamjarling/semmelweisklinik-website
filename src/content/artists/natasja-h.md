In the act of creation, I find my place.

A central thread weaves itself through my work:
humanity's place in nature - and its denial.

My background in fashion and creative art therapy
informs my hands and eye -

From the tactile intimacy of collage
to sculptural, 3D explorations

As a Semmel I am involved in the conceptgroup Coco&Co.
