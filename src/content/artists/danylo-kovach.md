Danylo Kovach was born into an artistic family in 1992 in the city of Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine. Since 2022 he lives and works in Vienna.

His work focuses on graphics, painting, installation, and performance. Danylo Kovach's practice is dynamically developing and changing. In traditional media, he tests the limits and possibilities of materials, sometimes undermining their semiotic meaning in order to reveal the unexpected materiality and nuances of his own artistic idea. In other approaches, he deliberately embeds his idea into the material, thus forming an added semantic component. His creative process is based on the juxtaposition of visual (material) and historical space. He journeys through the metaphorical and practical experience of objectivity, seeking to illuminate deep connections and contrasts. Each work is a testament to this desire, revealing a holistic approach that combines theoretical concepts with practical application.

His work is a powerful journey of experimentation, where the search for new and intriguing visual forms never stops. This urge leads him to conceptualize works of art that embody narrative symbolism, addressing human rights violations, instability, separation, and catharsis. One of the important elements of his artistic toolkit is the use of ordinary rubber mats, which he transforms into paintings and installations. With these objects, he opens up new perspectives on content and meaning. These formative elements constitute a semiotic language of images, breaking down narratives that resonate universally and inviting viewers to participate. It is an engagement in collaboration, communication, and the exchange of diverse experiences.
