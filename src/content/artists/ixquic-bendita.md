Multidisciplinary Artist - Cultural Worker - Alchemist of Everyday Resistance

Born in post-war Guatemala, Ixquic Bendita, also known as Julieta Lara, is a self-taught artist deeply rooted in art as a tool for transformation, resistance, and collective memory.

Her career, which began in the late 1990s, transcends disciplinary boundaries and encompasses a melting pot of languages: music, painting, poetry, papier-mache, performance, cooking, and cultural management. Her art is not academic; it is visceral and political, born from the urgency to survive, to heal, and to raise her voice from the margins.

Ixquic has developed her artistic skills outside of institutions, in the warmth of community gatherings and through exchanges with key figures in contemporary Guatemalan art.

Her works have graced festivals and stages-always with a political, spiritual, and deeply community-rooted approach. Her performance is body-memory, ritual, and protest; her painting is a cry; her music, urban alchemy.

As co-founder and driving force behind Simbiosis Kolective, Ixquic fosters cultural work that intertwines art, healing, community organizing, and decolonization. Connect with her work and vision at the links above.
