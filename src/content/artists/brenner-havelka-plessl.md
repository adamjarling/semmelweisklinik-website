Brenner-Havelka-Plessl is a collective, whose essential imperative is to set cooperative impulses and deepen interrelational communication. We create contemporary conceptual art, meaning that the medium and material we work with are always defined by the underlying idea. Our practice operates at the intersection of visual art, photography, performance, and book art, and is grounded in an interdisciplinary approach.

Geographically, our work is international in scope, with a particular focus on Central Europe. Projects and exhibitions have taken place in Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, China, and the United States. Our works have been presented in museums, galleries, and cultural institutions, including the mumok Vienna, the Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin, the Galerie Ernst Hilger, and Foto Arsenal Wien, as well as at venues in Bolzano, Zurich, Milan, Prague, and New York.

The shared approach together with individual technical skills, professional backgrounds and personal experiences, allows the collective to create a space for open exchange, to reach deeper understanding and empathy.

Max Brenner, the constant stream of images and messages is both a starting point and a source of inspiration for him.

Nick Havelka is a painter, printmaker and sculptor who provides deeply personal insights in his paintings, sketches and drawings.

Michael Plessl, whose research focuses on the possibilties of representation of an idea in its most concrete and pure form; the smallest form of communication that is still comprehensible.
