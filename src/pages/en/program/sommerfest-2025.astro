      <p class="mt-50">
        July 25, 2025. It's a unique sight: from the old building in Vienna's Währing district, 10 kilometers of spider-web-like, elastically floating silicone tubes stretch across the venerable park of the former Semmelweisklinik. Where silence was once celebrated to protect expectant mothers and the sick, this weekend the grounds and House 4 of the former women's and maternity clinic are buzzing with activity. For the third time, the Semmelweisklinik Art and Culture Center invites guests to celebrate, this year for the first time with a varied program over two days.

        And the summer festival is a complete success. Glittering leopards and other children painted as mythical creatures play table tennis or mini-golf among the old trees. On the main outdoor stage, artists dressed as mushrooms frolic; the variety, literature and music program with artists and bands from Austria offers entertainment of all kinds, magicians and clowns make young and old laugh. T-shirts are printed, people sing, eat and laze in colorful hammocks. Young visitors play in the ball pit or swing on the silicone tube nets stretched between the trees. A sculpture garden can be found in the park, and a few trees over, a puppet theater on the topic of human rights. Visitors refresh themselves at drink and food stands, while colorful garments and pictures from the free shop invite browsing. Children hop and lie on colorfully woven old bed springs and cushions, and in the solidarity fridge, donated and usable food awaits artists and the public as always. It's obvious: circular economy is written in capital letters at the Semmelweisklinik.

        And there's plenty to discover inside the building this weekend too. Entering the former laundry room with its imposing eight-meter-high walls, you're immersed in an installation of ice, sound, and video projections. Once work clothes and bed sheets were boiled and mangled here, but on these two days a quiet twilight prevails to best showcase the artists' works and interactive performances.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-20">
        These are two days full of surprises and beautiful moments for the approximately 750 visitors who explore the house and park despite the forecast rain. The summer festival is an absolute win for the neighborhood and all art enthusiasts who gladly take advantage of this cultural offering.

        The association at Semmelweisklinik has now existed for three years. Artists from around the world work here on approximately 3,800 square meters of space. Several generations and different artistic disciplines are represented: from painting, photography and dance to singing, performance, music and installation.

      <p class="mt-20">
        Currently, over 110 artists and cultural actors share 40 studio spaces in the building. And the number is growing: alongside permanent members, numerous other people intermittently enrich the house projects and actively participate. Because participation is possible even without your own studio.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-20">
        From the beginning, it was important to the association to create an open place – for everyone who wants to get involved. Especially in challenging times, we need spaces where society comes together, self-efficacy becomes tangible, collective creation is possible, and responsibility can be taken. Because only in this way can social change be actively shaped.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-20">
        "The commitment and motivation to create art and art initiatives are present in all participants. Not only we as artists benefit from this added value, but also the surroundings. What we need for this are affordable spaces."<br>
        - Pia Wolkenstein
      </p>
      <p class="mt-20">
        "What has connected us from the beginning was the love for this house and the shared vision of being able to try new things here and bring many people together. On a day like today, we all feel that this vision has become reality. That makes us happy and gives us courage to continue."<br>
        - Nathalie Frickey

        We thank everyone who made this festival possible. In addition to the many artists and our organization team, these are the many other helping hands. With their unwavering volunteer commitment, they are a good example of what the Semmelweisklinik Art and Culture Center is all about: creativity, perseverance and team spirit. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
